# Null-Pointers-Database-Design-Group-Task

📦 Team Null Pointers – Group Database Project
Welcome to the official repository of the Group Database Project by Team Null Pointers!
This project was developed as part of a coursework assignment and showcases our understanding of relational database systems, SQL, and sound database design principles.

📚 Project Overview
This project involves designing and implementing a database system for a specific domain (check the ER diagram for more context). The deliverables demonstrate practical skills in database normalization, data population, and query handling.

Included in the project:

✅ Relational schema creation script

✅ Populated tables with sample data

✅ Well-defined relationships and constraints

✅ Custom SQL queries for interaction and testing

✅ ER diagram to visualize the system structure
